# KiCad-libs

Libraries for KiCad containing unusal components like Nixie tubes, Vacuum Fluorescent Displays, early LED displays.

Feel free to contribute with your symbols and footprints, so perhaps one day there will be one single huge KiCad library for these obsolete but cute parts.

So far the following components have been drawn in KiCad format.

*NIXIE*
- symbols have been made generic taking into account the possible presence of decimal point(s), two anode pins, two anodes (still work in progress, but symbols match available footprints)
- SK-207 socket for ZM1332/5870S and all equivalents
- Eurogrid 55702 for ZM1000/ZM1001 and certainly more

*VFD*
- IV-6
- IV-22

*OLD LED DISPLAY*
- TIL305
